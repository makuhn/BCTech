# Introduction

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central includes the capability to track email message exchanges between salespeople and contacts so that the organization can manage customer relationships better. It's easy enough to set up, but it requires the organization to have enabled public folders on their mail server.  

Use this sample script as inspiration for how to set up public folders and mail flow rules in Exchange Online that are needed for the email logging functionality Business Central. For more information, see [Set up public folders and rules for email logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/business-central/marketing-set-up-email-logging#set-up-public-folders-and-rules-for-email-logging-in-exchange-online).
