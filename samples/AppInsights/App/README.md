# Deprecated
The code samples in this directory is not the recommended way to emit telemetry to Azure Application Insights if your environment is running version 16.0 or later.

# Sending signal to Application Insights from AL using the HTTPClient object
The code samples in this directory illustrates how this might be achieved by calling the Application Insights API though the HTTPClient object. 

** NB! Do be aware that the calls from the AL HTTPClient object are blocking as seen from AL execution. This means that AL execution will halt until the HTTPClient completes. The built-in platform support for telemetry does not have this limitation **

If your environment is running on version 17.0 or higher, consider using the [LogMessage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-instrument-application-for-telemetry-app-insights) method to implement custom telemetry.
