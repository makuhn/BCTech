In this folder, you will find samples of Kusto Query Language (KQL) for each type of signal that is sent to Application Insights.

# Usage of Kusto Queries
You can use Kusto queries as the data source in a number of places. E.g.
* the Logs part of Application Insights in the Azure portal
* PowerBI reports
* Azure Monitor Alerts
* Azure Dashboards
* Jupyter Notebooks (with the Kqlmagic extension)
