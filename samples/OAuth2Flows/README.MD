# Introduction to OAuth2 Flows

This extension is an example on how to use all the OAuth 2.0 protocol authentication flows exposed by Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.

OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol is supported by Business Central and can be used by internal and external AL developers. The functionality has been exposed as part of [Microsoft AL application foundation System Module](https://github.com/microsoft/ALAppExtensions/tree/master/Modules/System/OAuth2) and exposes procedures that support and implement the OAuth 2.0 [Authorization Code Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows#authorization-code), [Client Credentials flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows#client-credentials) and [On-Behalf-Of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-authentication-flows#on-behalf-of).

As a prerequisite for testing the functionality of this extension, the user must [register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/auth-register-app-v2), making sure that they define the correct Redirect URI, such as [https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm](https://businesscentral.dynamics.com/OAuthLanding.htm), and a client secret. Going forward, the user must [configure the client application to access web APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-access-web-apis). For the sample extension, the required permissions are *Microsoft Graph User.Read Delegated* permissions and *User.Read.All Application* permissions.

After the extension has been published, the setup section parameters must be completed for the various flows to succeed. The values for all the parameters in this section are the ones defined or auto-generated in the Azure Active Directory application, except for the **User Email**, which must be filled in with the current user's email address.
